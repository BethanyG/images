# Images

A repository to store all the images used by Exercism, for example those used across social media or in OpenGraph data. This repo syncs with S3 where the images are served from.

Everything must be put under `images`.

URLs should currently point to `https://assets.exercism.org/[PATH_IN_THIS_REPO`. For example:
- The file at `images/exercises/paint-by-number/smiley-numbers.png`
- is hosted at https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/paint-by-number/smiley-numbers.png
